Notes about the command format:
* When entering commands in the system, please ensure you include a space between each parameter.
  Example of incorrect format:
  ```add category/1amt/1.125456789 d/11-11-2025```
  Example of correct format:
 ```add category/1amt 1.125456789 d/11-11-2025```
This note applies to all commands. The above is an example of add income command.
  The system expects space separation between the category parameter, amount value, and date parameter. Without proper spacing, the system may misinterpret your input or generate unexpected results.
* For all commands involving monetary amounts (e.g., income or expense entries), the following rules apply:
✅ The integer part of the amount must not exceed 7 digits.
✅ The decimal part must not exceed 2 digits (i.e., cents).
These constraints reflect realistic daily usage for students, the primary target users of this application. As such, it is unlikely that users would need to record transactions involving more than 7 digits, and dollar amounts conventionally support up to 2 decimal places.
* This app is meant for users who prefer to type in CLI-command in English. For other language characters, the chatbot may not be able to parse them.
