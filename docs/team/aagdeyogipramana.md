# A.A. Gde Yogi Pramana - Project Portfolio Page

## Overview

This project provides a robust financial management solution enabling users to manage incomes and expenses efficiently. It features a comprehensive command parser, standardized user interface, extensive validation, and rigorous testing practices to ensure reliability, usability, and maintainability.

## Summary of Contributions

### 1. **Command Parsing and Input Handling**
- Developed and refined the `Parser` class to handle complex user inputs, interpreting commands for income and expense management, data filtering, updating, and general help functionality.
- Enhanced command validation to provide clear, actionable feedback for incorrect or unknown inputs.

### 2. **User Interface Standardization**
- Established consistent formatting across command outputs, particularly in filtering commands (e.g., `FilterIncomeByDateCommand` and `FilterIncomeByCategoryCommand`), implementing structured table formats for clarity and ease of understanding.
- Improved overall user experience by refining usage guides, error notifications, and interface responsiveness.

### 3. **Code Quality and Checkstyle Compliance**
- Conducted systematic code reviews and resolved Checkstyle issues (indentation, line-length violations, improper imports) in essential components including `Parser.java`, `HelpCommand.java`, and test suites.
- Ensured consistent adherence to project-specific Java coding standards, significantly improving readability and reducing future technical debt.

### 4. **Comprehensive Unit Testing**
- Developed extensive JUnit tests (e.g., `ParserTest.java`, `FilterIncomeByDateCommandTest.java`, `FilterIncomeByCategoryCommandTest.java`) to cover a wide range of scenarios including typical use cases, boundary conditions, invalid inputs, and exception handling.
- Strengthened the reliability of command execution and input parsing through thorough testing, catching edge cases early in the development process.

### 5. **Bug Fixes and Feature Enhancements**
- Identified and corrected parsing errors related to income filtering commands, ensuring accurate interpretation of multiple filter parameters.
- Improved robustness of date and category filtering functionalities by incorporating enhanced input validation and clearer user instructions.

### 6. **Documentation and Team Collaboration**
- Authored detailed, informative Javadoc comments explaining class purposes, command syntax, usage examples, and exception handling clearly.
- Actively engaged with team members, integrating feedback and maintaining coherent, high-quality documentation and codebase consistency throughout the project lifecycle.
