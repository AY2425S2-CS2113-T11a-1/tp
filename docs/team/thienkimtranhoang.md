## Project: BudgetFlow:
Budgetflow is a personal finance management application designed to help students efficiently track their income,
expenses, and savings goals. With a simple, command-based interface, Budgetflow allows users to log their transactions,
filter them by category or date, and analyze their financial habits. It is written in Java with 4kLoC.

### Summary of Contributions
* __New Feature:__ Added the ability to log income entries:
    * **What it does:** This feature allows users to record their income using the `add` command. The user provides the `category`, `amount`, and `date` of the income, which is then saved in the Income List.
    * **Justification:** This feature helps users track their earnings efficiently, allowing them to gain a clearer understanding of their financial inflows. By maintaining a record of their income, users can make informed budgeting decisions.
  * **Highlights:** The feature supports categorization, making it easier for users to differentiate between different
    income sources such as salary, freelance work, and bonuses. Besides, trailing spaces after/before parameters and
    restrictions on values (i.e amount) are also enhanced to ensure consistency throughout the chatbot.
